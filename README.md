(flocking robot going through a maze)


## Description

We create a robot that is composed of a bulk of particles surrounded by a boundary layer or "skin". The skin is is made up of of adaptable Vicsek particles and the bulk is made up of passive particles. We then simulate the movement of this robot though an obstacle course. The robot is able to move around the obstacles without exerting much force on them like an Amoeba!

## Usage

Please follow along main.py with function library func.py and ploting library visual_lib.py

Simulating a flocking robot that moves downward through a maze. The sizes of the maze/robot and the interactions between them are customizable.
