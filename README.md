(flocking robot going through a maze)


## Description

We create a robot that is composed of a bulk of particles surrounded by a boundary layer or "skin". The skin is is made up of of adaptable Vicsek particles and the bulk is made up of passive particles. We then simulate the movement of this robot though an obstacle course. The robot is able to move around the obstacles without exerting much force on them like an Amoeba!

## Usage

Please follow along these jupyter notebooks:

1. adaptive_robot.ipynb 

Simulating a flocking robot that moves downward through a maze. The sizes of the maze/robot and the interactions between them are customizable.

2.interactive-soft robot.ipynb

Creating an enviornment where you can change the maze in real time.
